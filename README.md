## Installation
Million Framework is an editor-only Unreal Engine 4.26 project requires a modified UE4.26 to work properly. However, due to Unreal Engine's EULA limitations, we cannot freely distribute pre-compiled version of the editor.

If you wish to build the editor yourself, you can do so by opening this repository:
https://github.com/TheHoodieGuy02/UnrealEngine

Otherwise, pre-compiled version only provided after verifying your licence through [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/xgvqQwmPkP). Note that the pre-compiled version is stripped down to be focused for linear media creation and does not include any game making functionalities.
